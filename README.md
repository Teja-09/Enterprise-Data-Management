# Tugo Bike Share Data Management System

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Tugo Bike Share Data Management System. This comprehensive solution is developed to manage and analyze data for Tugo Bike Share as part of an Enterprise Data Management course.

## Project Overview

This system is designed to streamline operations for Tugo Bike Share, encompassing comprehensive data management functionalities, such as customer management, bike and station maintenance, and deep business analytics. The backend is powered by Oracle Database with a Flask-driven API and a dynamic front-end.

## Key Components

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

- The ER diagram includes over 30 entities with complex relationships, providing a clear visual representation of the database structure.
- This diagram is crucial for understanding the interdependencies and the flow of data throughout the system.
- It supports the normalization process to ensure the database is free of redundancy and promotes data integrity.

### Oracle Database

- **Schema Design**: The database schema is derived directly from the ER diagram, focusing on normalization to reduce data redundancy.
- **SQL Implementation**: Utilizes advanced Oracle SQL features, including triggers, procedures, and functions to automate and simplify database operations.
- **Security and Integrity**: Implements constraints and access controls to ensure data security and integrity.

### Business Insights through SQL Queries

- **Analytical Queries**: Includes complex SQL queries designed to extract actionable insights from the data, such as identifying top customers, bike usage hotspots, and revenue trends.
- **Decision Support**: The information gleaned from these queries aids in strategic decision-making such as promotional targeting, station maintenance scheduling, and inventory management.
- **Reports**: Custom reports can be generated to provide ongoing insights into business performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Management**: Manage a vast array of information related to customers, bikes, rentals, and employees.
- **Dynamic Reporting Tools**: Enable real-time decision-making based on current data analytics.
- **User Authentication**: Secure multiple user roles to ensure data access is appropriately managed.
